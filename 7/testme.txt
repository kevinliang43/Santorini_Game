TESTME Description

1) HOW TO RUN A SINGLE TEST

Within the 7/ Directory, run the following command, but replace the n character with a number:
./xrules < rules-tests/n-in.json | diff - rules-tests/n-out.json 

For example, to run the test on 5-in.json:
./xrules < rules-tests/5-in.json | diff - rules-tests/5-out.json 


2) HOW TO RUN ALL TESTS

Within the 7/ Directory, run the following command:

./TESTME


The TESTME Executable will run ./xrules on all 5 prewritten n-in.json files as input, and compare the output
to their respective n-out.json files



3) HOW TO READ TEST RESULTS:

Because we are using the diff command to locate differences between running ./xrules on various json inputs and the expected output json files, no text output to the terminal will signal that all tests have passed.


4) TEST DESCRIPTIONS:

1-in.json:
	Tests regular move + build attempts.
	Tests move and build on previous Cell.

2-in.json:
	Tests valid movements, and building off a grid.

3-in.json:
	Tests moving onto a Worker
	Tests moving onto a Cell of a height greater than 1 from the original Cell
	(Moving from 0 -> 2 is NOT OK)

4-in.json:
	Tests moving onto a Cell of a height 1 greater than the original cell will work
	as long as you are not moving to a cell of max height.
	(Moving from height 0 -> 1 is OK)
	(Moving from height 3 -> 4 is NOT OK)

5-in.json
	Test move + build on top of Worker
	Test move + build on height 4 (NOT OK)
	Test move + build on height 3 (OK)
	Test build on building of height > 1 compared to origin Cell (OK).
